### Analytics Dashboard

The Analytics Widget can be used to create and position multiple reports on a single page. Reports can be previewed and customised before being saved for ongoing use.
This enables users to create a personalised dashboard of their favourite/most-viewed reports for easy, repeat access.

### Customise Reports to Answer Specific Questions

A Report also provides the capability to customise the query underlying its data to answer more specific questions. There are 4 main customisation options;

#### Customise Query Parameters
Make reports more specific by specifying parameters such as who, when, where,
what, etc. using filters for Community, User, Application, Time Period, Event Type,
etc.
