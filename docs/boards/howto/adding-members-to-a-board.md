Adding members to your board allows you to collaborate with your team, your whole organisation and even external parties outside of your company. There is no limit to the number of people you can have as members of a board.

### Adding Members to a New Board

You can add members when you first create a board.

In the *New Board* creation phase, type in the name of any colleague or group in your organisation in the Add People field, or type in an email address of someone who is external to your organisation.

You can also decide if you would like the board to have Public Access, meaning anyone in your organisation will be able to view the board (although not able to contribute unless they have been invited.)

### Adding Members to an Existing Board

At any stage of your work, you can add members to a board.

From within your board, select `Members` from the menu on the right-hand side. From here, you’ll be able to see current members or add new ones. Type in the name of any colleague or group in your organisation in the add members field, or type in an email address of someone who is external to your organisation.

Don’t forget to click the `Add Members` button before closing the window.

New members will be notified that they have been invited to your board.

### Managing Members in a Microsoft Team Channel and Board

[A board can be added to a channel within Teams](/boards/howto/adding-boards-to-teams/) to help track progress on tasks and create a collaborative work environment.

When members are added to a channel, this automatically adds them as a member of the board.

You can add members to a channel when you first create it, or at any point after that. When a board is connected to the channel, the members will automatically be added to the board.

Click the` …` to the right of your channel. Then select `Manage Team.` From here, you’ll see existing members and have the opportunity to `Add Members,` using the button on the right-hand side of the screen.

Note, that adding members from this location, will allow you to only add members or groups from within your organisation, as this is adding them to both the channel in Microsoft Teams and the board.

To add people external to your organisation, do so directly from the board. They will have access only to the board, not to the Microsoft Team Channel.
